## Testing Plan

The platform’s testing strategy ensures high-quality and reliable deployment.

* **Unit Testing:** Logic and algorithm tests built on Vitest, automated via GitHub Actions.

* **Integration Testing:** SPA/API integration and Supabase API connectivity, all implemented using Vitest.

* **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulated user journeys via Playwright, including real-time updates via Supabase.

**Testing Workflow:**

* All tests (unit and integration via Vitest, E2E via Playwright) run automatically on GitHub Actions for every PR/merge to main

* Manual exploratory and real-time scenarios tested pre-release

---

## Test Strategies

* **Static Analysis:** Lint/type-check via Vite and ESLint

* **Unit Tests:** Core business logic, Supabase communication, covered with Vitest

* **Integration Tests:** End-to-end user flows (business logic to Supabase), covered with Vitest
