## Narrative

Every year, Maria and her university friends promise to meet up, but busy schedules and scattered locations turn coordination into a hassle. Finding a date that works, a place everyone likes, and simply keeping the momentum going—all prove frustrating. This year, Maria tries Lets Meet Up. After a fast signup, she creates a group and shares a link with her friends. Each person marks their available times in seconds and, with one tap, syncs their calendars to avoid conflicts. The app smartly suggests a nearby restaurant that fits everyone's preferences—a spot exactly halfway between the group—and displays it on a map for context.

Votes roll in quickly; reminders nudge anyone lagging. Within a day, everyone confirms a date and place, and RSVP status updates instantly for all. The app even sends calendar invites and a simple map link. The group finally reconnects, sharing laughter and memories, grateful that logistics melted away. For Maria and her friends, the difference was clear: they spent less time planning and more time together. Lets Meet Up not only solved a practical problem but renewed friendships and rekindled meaningful connections, delivering value both for the group and the business through happy, returning users.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* Modular front-end (SPA/mobile-first) for rapid interaction and ease of use

* Scalable back-end to manage group/state, events, and notifications

* Integration with:

  * Calendar APIs (Google, Outlook)

  * Venue/Activity APIs (Google Places, Yelp, Eventbrite)

* Simple, secure user data model (profile, groups, availability, preferences)

* Notification engine for alerts and reminders (email, push)

### Integration Points

* Google Calendar API, Microsoft Outlook API (for availability sync)

* Google Places, Yelp, Eventbrite (for venue/activity suggestions)

* Basic cloud storage for user and group data

### Data Storage & Privacy

* All user data encrypted at rest and in transit

* Personal data (calendar, location) shared only with user’s explicit consent, group-limited by default

* Adhere to GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations

* Minimal data retention—delete unneeded historical info regularly

### Scalability & Performance

* Target: 5,000+ concurrent users in v1

* Low-latency performance for real-time group updates and map interactions

* Graceful degradation/fallback for partial API outages

### Potential Challenges

* Managing calendar/data permission scopes and revocation gracefully

* Ensuring location privacy while enabling group visualization

* Handling API rate limits and failures for third-party providers

* Out-of-scope: No messaging, chat, or payment/transaction integration
